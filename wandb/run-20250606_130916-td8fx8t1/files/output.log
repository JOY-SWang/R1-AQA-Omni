It allows you to define functions that accept any type of input. Just make sure to import the typing module at the start of your file. The function signature should specify the type hint for each input parameter. When it comes to deciding on whether to apply multiple functions to the same list or merge the lists, that's a bit more subjective. If you have a list of lists and you want to combine all the elements into one large list, you could use a function that iterates through each sublist and adds each element to a new list. Conversely, if, I d suggest creating a clear set of requirements and testing cases for your function first. This could help guide your function's design and ensure it meets your needs correctly.
